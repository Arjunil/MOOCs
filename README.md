# MOOCs
Umbrella repo for future moocs

The ones that I intend to dig into in the future (probably winter 2019) are listed below:
1. Deep Learning with [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) : get some hands on experience with pyTorch and fastai because I have heard too many people rave about them at this point and this [book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/about.html) might help me along
Finally get to [deployment](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/)

2. [Stanford NLP with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) : Because I need to brush up on some of this stuff and Prof. Manning presents everything so beautifully.

3. Stuff I probably also want to revisit at some point are a few of the papers listed [here](https://kennyjoseph.github.io/cse702) from my second semester course on Applied NLP and Computational Social Science.


##### Note: This started out as a MOOC list but is turning into a to do list quite quick.
