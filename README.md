# MOOCs
Umbrella repo for future moocs

The ones that I intend to dig into in the future (probably winter 2019) are listed below:
1. [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) : get some hands on experience with pyTorch because I have heard too many people rave about it at this point.

2. [Stanford NLP with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) : Because I need to brush up on some of this stuff and Prof. Manning presents everything so beautifully.

3. Stuff I probably also want to revisit at some point are a few of the papers listed [here](https://kennyjoseph.github.io/cse702) . A course that was part of my 2nd semester at UB introduced me to some great stuff in NLP.
