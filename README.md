# MOOCs
Umbrella repo for future moocs

The ones that I intend to dig into in the future (probably winter 2019) are listed below:
1. fastai one (https://www.fast.ai/) : get some hands on experience with pyTorch because I have heard too many people rave about it at this point.
2. Stanford NLP with Deep Learning (http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) : Because I need to brush up on some of this stuff and Prof. Manning presents everything so beautifully.
